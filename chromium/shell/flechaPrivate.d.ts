/**
 * chrome.flechaPrivate: what Flecha's browser (the native patches) gives the shell, and only

 * page area and the traffic lights out around it.
 *
 * Absent in stock Chromium; the shell then falls back to the side panel.
 *
 * Layout, the same numbers as the Electron spike's Browser.layout():
 *  SIDEBAR is FrameState.sidebarWidth, 260 by default.
 *  - sidebar 'docked':   frame view = left strip SIDEBAR (260) wide; page area = x 260, y 8,
 *                        to 8 from the right and bottom edges. Traffic lights shown at (16, 18).
 *  - sidebar 'hidden':   frame view = left strip EDGE (8) wide, for the hover edge; page area
 *                        x 8. Traffic lights hidden.
 *  - sidebar 'floating': frame view = FLOAT_MARGIN + SIDEBAR + FLOAT_SHADOW (10 + 260 + 28)
 *                        wide, over the page; page area as 'hidden'. Traffic lights shown at
 *                        (16 + 10, 18 + 10).
 *  - overlay: true:      frame view covers the whole window (command bar, Peek, tour, tab
 *                        drag); the page area doesn't move.
 * The frame view stays above the page; its transparent pixels show the page beneath but
 * still take the mouse within the view's bounds, as in Electron.
